spyro: Acoustic wave modeling in Firedrake
============================================

spyro is a Python library for modeling acoustic waves. The main
functionality is a set of forward and discrete adjoint wave propagators for solving the acoustic wave equation in the time domain.
These wave propagators can be used to form complete Full Waveform Inversion or Reverse Time Migration applications. See the [demos](https://github.com/krober10nd/spyro/tree/main/demos).
To implement these solvers, spyro uses the finite element package [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/index.html).

To use Spyro, you'll need to have some knowledge of Python and some basic concepts in inverse modeling relevant to active-sourcce seismology.

Functionality
=============

* Finite Element discretizations for scalar wave equation in 2D and 3D using triangular and tetrahedral meshes.
    * Continuous Galerkin with arbitrary spatial order and stable and accurate higher-order mass lumping up to p = 5.
* Spatial and ensemble (*shot*) parallelism for source simulations.
* Leapfrog and Strong Stability Preserving Runga-Kutta (SSPRK) time-stepping schemes (up to 4th order accurate in time).
* Perfectly Matched Layer to absorb reflected waves in both 2D and 3D.
* Mesh-independent functional gradient for Leapfrog and SSPRK time-stepping methods using the discrete adjoint method.
* Sparse interpolation and injection.

Using this functionality, short Python scripts can written that perform Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) type algorithms using well-developed numerical optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS from the SciPy package. See the notebooks folder for an FWI example.

Performance
===========

Strong scaling on both Intel Xeon processors and AMD processors is quite good. This test was performed with an 11 M DoF 3D tetrahedral mesh adapted to the Overthrust3D model. A 1 second wave simulation was executed with a 750-m PML on all sides but the free surface:

A worked example
=================

A simple example of a forward simulation in 2D on a rectangle with a uniform triangular mesh and using the Perfectly Matched Layer is like the following below. Note here we first specify the input file and build a uniform mesh using the meshing capabilities provided by Firedrake. However, more complex meshes for realistic problems can be generated via [SeismicMesh](https://github.com/krober10nd/SeismicMesh).


See the demos folder for an FWI example (this requires some other dependencies pyrol and ROLtrilinos).
