    "This tutorial was prepared by Alexandre Olender olender@usp.br\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on **Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)** using spyro's `FullWaveformInversion` class. Full Waveform Inversion is an advanced technique in seismic imaging that uses the full waveform information to reconstruct subsurface velocity models. Unlike methods that use only arrival times or amplitudes, FWI leverages the complete seismic waveform, including phases, amplitudes, and frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Full Waveform Inversion?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical FWI is an iterative PDE-constrained optimization process that minimizes a cost functional, such as, the difference between observed seismic data and synthetic data generated from a velocity model. The cost functional to be minimized varies depending on your desired FWI research. The process can involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward modeling**: Solving the wave equation to generate synthetic seismograms\n",
    "2. **Residual calculation**: Computing the difference between observed and synthetic data  \n",
    "3. **Adjoint modeling**: A computationally cheaper way of computing gradients of the objective function related to the control variable (our material property, which for acoustic FWI is the wave velocity, Vp).\n",
    "4. **Model update**: Updating the velocity model to reduce the data misfit\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a complete FWI workflow, from generating synthetic \"observed\" data to performing the inversion and analyzing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of the forward modeling tutorial."

    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully completed a Full Waveform Inversion tutorial using Spyro. Here's what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Did:\n",
    "1. **Generated synthetic data** using a complex velocity model with circular and rectangular anomalies\n",
    "2. **Set up an FWI problem** with proper mesh, acquisition geometry, and time domain parameters\n",
    "3. **Performed iterative inversion** starting from a simple constant velocity model\n",
    "4. **Recovered subsurface structure** that was initially unknown to the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key FWI Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "- **Forward modeling**: Computing synthetic seismograms from velocity models\n",
    "- **Data misfit**: Measuring differences between observed and synthetic data\n",
    "- **Gradient computation**: Using adjoint methods to compute model updates\n",
    "- **Iterative optimization**: Gradually improving the velocity model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "- **Oil and gas exploration**: Imaging complex subsurface structures\n",
    "- **Earthquake seismology**: Understanding Earth's interior structure  \n",
    "- **Geothermal exploration**: Mapping temperature and fluid distributions\n",
    "- **Carbon sequestration**: Monitoring CO₂ injection and storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Exploration:\n",
    "- Try different initial models and see how it affects convergence\n",
    "- Experiment with different frequencies and acquisition geometries\n",
    "- Explore multi-scale FWI by starting with low frequencies and gradually increasing\n",
    "- Investigate 3D FWI problems for more realistic scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Topics:\n",
    "- **Multi-parameter inversion**: Simultaneously inverting for velocity and density\n",
    "- **Elastic FWI**: Including S-wave velocities and more complex physics\n",
    "- **Time-lapse FWI**: Monitoring changes over time\n",
    "- **Machine learning integration**: Using AI to improve FWI workflows\n",
