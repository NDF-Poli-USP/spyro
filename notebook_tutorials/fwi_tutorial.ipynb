    "This tutorial was prepared by Alexandre Olender olender@usp.br\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on **Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)** using spyro's `FullWaveformInversion` class. Full Waveform Inversion is an advanced technique in seismic imaging that uses the full waveform information to reconstruct subsurface velocity models. Unlike traditional methods that use only arrival times or amplitudes, FWI leverages the complete seismic waveform, including phases, amplitudes, and frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Full Waveform Inversion?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical FWI is an iterative PDE-constrained optimization process that minimizes the difference between observed seismic data and synthetic data generated from a velocity model. The cost functional to be minimized varies depending on your desired FWI research. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward modeling**: Solving the wave equation to generate synthetic seismograms\n",
    "2. **Residual calculation**: Computing the difference between observed and synthetic data  \n",
    "3. **Adjoint modeling**: Computing gradients of the objective function related to the control variable (acoustic propagation velocity)\n",
    "4. **Model update**: Updating the velocity model to reduce the data misfit\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a complete FWI workflow, from generating synthetic \"observed\" data to performing the inversion and analyzing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of seismic wave propagation and the forward modeling tutorial."
