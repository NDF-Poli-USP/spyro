    """Sets up a basic model parameter class for examples and test case models.
    It has the option of reading a dictionary, and if any parameter is missing

    this dictioanry it calls on a default value, that should be defined in the
    relevant
    example file.

    Example Setup

    These examples are intended as reusable velocity model configurations to assist in the development and testing of new methods, such as optimization algorithms, time-marching schemes, or inversion techniques.

    Unlike targeted test cases, these examples do not have a specific objective or expected result. Instead, they provide standardized setups, such as Camembert, rectangular, and Marmousi velocity models, that can be quickly reused when prototyping, testing, or validating new functionality.

    By isolating the setup of common velocity models, we aim to reduce boilerplate and encourage consistency across experiments.

    Feel free to adapt these templates to your needs.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    dictionary: 'python dictionary' (optional): dictionary with changes to the
    default parameters

    default_dictionary: python 'dictionary': default parameters
