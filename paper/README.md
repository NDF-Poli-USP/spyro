* This directory contains the 2D and 3D FWI scripts to reproduce the results from the paper titled "Full waveform inversion using triangular waveform-adapted meshes". Meshes and associated velocity models can be downloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5172307#.YRFJoS1h1pQ)
* For the 2D FWI, the guess meshes are generated by running the Python script `make_guess_meshes.py` which uses the Python package [SeismicMesh](https://github.com/krober10nd/SeismicMesh) but for 3D, they are present inside the zip file that can be downloaded above.
