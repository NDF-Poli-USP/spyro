What is this?
=============

* These files demonstrate how to perform a synthetic full waveform inversion (FWI) using the forward and adjoint wave propagators developed in spyro.

* To solve the optimization problem, these programs use the [Rapid Optimization Library](https://trilinos.github.io/pdfs/ROL.pdf) which is interfaced in Python via [pyrol](https://bitbucket.org/pyrol/pyrol/src/master/)
